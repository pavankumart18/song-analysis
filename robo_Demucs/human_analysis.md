# Human Analysis

1. demucs not able to differentiate between lyrics and human voices but its reasonable because both will be similiar in signals 

2. because of bacgrkound noise by voices it segments very less because signals are always continous as segments are divided using signals and pitches 

3. as lyrics are continous it is not able to label correctly 

4. sam perfmoed in some segments perfectly but not upto the mark but better than demucs in this song
