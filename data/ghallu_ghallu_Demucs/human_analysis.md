# HUMAN ANALYSIS

my analysis on demucs was it is absolutely doing great job in seperating vocals from songs 
key things i have observed to be taken away from this song is 
1. demucs is good at getting vocals from songs 

key drawbacks of with song analysis which is not a part of demucs but llm is not able to deletect the pitches and not able to label the segments of the song that are derived from the demucs vocals 90% it is doing good because in real life we know how the songs stop but what i am sending to llm was a json file + song name as well which has where the vocals are in the song that was seperated using demucs 
labeling can be imporved but the seperation quality here is nice 

my analysis on sam - small seperated model 
1. sam seperately vocals perfectly but the problem is sometimes it assumes instruments as vocals and sometimes it assumes vocals as instruments 
2. most of the times it removes background noise from vocals 
3. it is not able to detect differentiation between vocals and some instruments example flutes and violins
