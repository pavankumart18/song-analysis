# Human Analysis

1. demucs is doing good in seperating but taking some backgound voices which is ignored by sam 

2. some hums as vocals by demucs but not majorly 

3. taking human speaking as vocals 

4. sam performed better in this song but not able to label correctly

5. but sometimes taking flute as vocals means instruments as vocals here

but sam is good in somewhat removing background noise in some cases as like 60% cases

6. majorly considering violin as human voice especially female voice
