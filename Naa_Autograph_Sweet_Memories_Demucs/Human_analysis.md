# Human Analysis

1. in demucs it is taking soemtimes a instrument as vocal example violin which almost sounds like a human voice may be because of that 
2. becuase of this identification of violin as human vocal sometimes it is merging pallavi and charanam 

3. in sam considering small spikes as vocals and same violin as vocals, sam is taking too much background voice as vocals in this song 

4. for demucs it is identifying but labeling was not perfect.
